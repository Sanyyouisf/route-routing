<p><strong>The State Route System of Tennessee</strong> is maintained and developed by the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) US state of Tennessee. Currently the state has 14,150 miles (22,770 km) of state-maintained roadways, including 1,073 miles (1,727 km) of Interstate Highways and 13,077 miles (21,045 km) of State Highways.[1] All of the U.S. Routes in Tennessee have a state route routed concurrently with them, though the state route is hidden and only signed along the green mile marker signs that display mileage within each county. Since 1982, State routes have been divided into primary and secondary routes. Primary State routes are part of the Federal-aid primary highway system, whereas secondary routes are not.</p>
